          <p><b>Yesterday</b><br> All my troubles seemed to be so far away <br> Now it looks as though they're here to stay <br>Oh, I believe in yesterday </p>
          <p>Suddenly <br>I'm not half the man I used to be <br>There's a shadow hanging over me <br>Oh, yesterday came suddenly </p>
          <p>Why she <br> Had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say <br>I said <br>Something wrong, now I long for yesterday </p>
          <p><i>Yesterday</i> <br>Love was such an easy game to play <br>Now I need a place to hide away <br>Oh, I believe in <strong>yesterday</strong></p>

        <p>But of all these friends and lovers <br> There is no one compares with you <br> And these memories lose their meaning <br> When I think of love as something new <br> Though I know I'll never lose affection <br> For people and things that went before <br> I know I'll often stop and think about them <br> In my life, I'll love you more </p>

Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day
Ah girl
Girl
 
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah, girl
Girl
 
She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
She's cool, cool, cool, cool
Girl
Girl
 
Was she told when she was young that pain
Would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn
His day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah girl
Girl
Girl
 
Ah girl
Girl

        <pre>
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
 
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
 
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
 
And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
 
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be answer
Let it be
 
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be answer
 
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
 
(Instrumental session)
 
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
 
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be
 
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be, yeah
 
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah let it be
There will be answer
Let it be
 
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
